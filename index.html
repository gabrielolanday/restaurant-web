    <p > Hey, everybody! Welcome to Scott's Tots! In 2000, I promised a
        class of adorable underprivileged third graders that if they excelled
        academically, then I would pay their college tuition through the Michael
        Scott Foundation. The media and I affectionately called them "Scott's
        Tots". 9 years later I had to crush their hopes and dreams by telling
        them that I actually couldn't afford to pay for their tuition. I had no
        idea college even cost that much money! But because of this, I decided
        I had to give back to my community, and also somehow get rid of the crippling
        guilt of ruining the lives of a dozen young adults. So I opened Scott's
        Tots!
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here at Scott's Tots, each tater tot is made with the most love and care
        imaginable. Just like our slogan says, we want you to be afraid of how
        much you love our tots!
